Problem 1:
Consider the tangency portfolio that achieves 10% annual return, using the histor
ical data for the expected returns and risks for the periods 2020-2022 and 2023-present
from part (a) and (b) in HW 2.
Part (a):
Using the code in the lecture slides calculate VaR for 1 day horizon, nonparametri
cally for confidence level 0.99 for these portfolios. Further, assume that the investment
is $10 billion.
Part (b):
Also, provide 95% confidence intervals for the VaR and comment on the results
obtained in Part (a).
Part (c): How do the results change in Parts (a) and (b) if the horizon changes
to 1 week?

Problem 2:
Consider the tangency and minimum variance portfolios considered in Problem
1 of HW 3.
Part (a):
An investor plans to invest $ 10 billion on the above portfolios. The investor
is interested in calculating the VaR and a 95% confidence interval for 1 day horizon,
assuming that the returns of these portfolios can be modeled by a multivariate t
distribution. Assume confidence level for the VaR 0.99.
Report and comment on the result.
Part (c):
How do the results change if the horizon for VaR becomes 1 week horizon?
Report and comment on the result and how it changes compared to that of Part
(a).
